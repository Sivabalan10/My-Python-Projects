# My Python Projects

This repository showcases my Python projects, which demonstrate my skills in developing AI applications, full-stack systems, and automation scripts. Below is a brief overview of each project.

## Projects

### 1. AVIS - The Speech Recognition AI

**Description:**
AVIS is an advanced speech recognition AI that understands spoken commands and responds accordingly. It uses hardcoded responses and queries Wikipedia for information. If it encounters an unknown query, it stores the query in its memory (`brain.txt`) for future learning. This AI system is entirely coded by me and incorporates a custom-built architecture.

**Features:**
- **Speech Recognition**: Understands and processes spoken commands.
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Fetches information from Wikipedia.
- **Memory Storage**: Stores unrecognized queries for future learning.
- **Custom Architecture**: Developed from scratch to handle speech processing and response generation.

### 2. Bank Transaction System

**Description:**
This project is a full-stack banking transaction system developed using pure Python. It manages transaction and account details without a graphical interface, storing all information in text files.

**Features:**
- **Account Management**: Create and manage bank accounts.
- **Transaction Processing**: Handle deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Data Storage**: Store account and transaction details in text files.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Implements backend logic and data storage without an interface.

### 3. Auto Window Screen Refreshing AI for Windows

**Description:**
This project is an automation script designed to refresh the Windows screen periodically. It ensures that the screen does not go to sleep or become unresponsive, which is particularly useful for applications that require constant monitoring or for preventing screen lock during presentations.

**Features:**
- **Screen Refreshing**: Automatically refreshes the Windows screen at regular intervals.
- **Prevents Screen Lock**: Keeps the screen active and prevents it from going to sleep.
- **Simple Automation**: Lightweight and easy-to-use script for maintaining screen activity.
